# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains various C++ programs demonstrating fundamental data structures and algorithms, including lists, stacks, queues, and trees. The emphasis of these files is on understanding basic and advanced data structures, including linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular lists, binary trees, and the use of graphs. Below is a brief overview of each file:

## 1. **Array Operations (`1.- Array operations.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file demonstrates basic operations with arrays, such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   - **Concepts Covered**: 
     - Basic array manipulation
     - Looping and indexing techniques

## 2. **Stacks and Queues (`2.- Stacks and Queues.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file covers the implementation and operations of stacks and queues.
   - **Concepts Covered**:
     - Stack operations (Push, Pop, Peek)
     - Queue operations (Enqueue, Dequeue, Front)
     - Understanding LIFO (Last In First Out) and FIFO (First In First Out) principles

## 3. **Lists (`1.- Lists.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file introduces basic singly linked lists and their operations.
   - **Concepts Covered**:
     - Singly linked list creation
     - Node insertion, deletion, and traversal

## 4. **Doubly Linked List (`2.- Doubly Linked List.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file extends the concept of linked lists by introducing doubly linked lists, where each node points to both the next and the previous node.
   - **Concepts Covered**:
     - Node structure with two pointers (previous and next)
     - Bidirectional traversal
     - Enhanced insertion and deletion operations

## 5. **Circular List (`3.- Circular List.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file focuses on the implementation of circular linked lists, where the last node points back to the first node.
   - **Concepts Covered**:
     - Circular structure in linked lists
     - Continuous traversal without termination
     - Applications in buffering and scheduling systems

## 6. **Music Player (`Music player.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file simulates a basic music player using data structures to manage playlists and tracks.
   - **Concepts Covered**:
     - Queue implementation for playlist management
     - Stack usage for managing recently played tracks
     - Circular lists for repeated track playback

## 7. **Train Station Project (`train station project.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file models a train station system using graph theory concepts.
   - **Concepts Covered**:
     - **Graph Representation**: Stations as nodes and routes as edges
     - **Graph Traversal**: Finding the shortest path, route optimization
     - **Algorithms**: Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path

## 8. **Binary Tree (`binary tree.cpp`)**
   - **Description**: This file implements a binary tree and covers basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.
   - **Concepts Covered**:
     - Binary tree creation and traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
     - Recursive and iterative methods
     - Node balancing concepts

### Graph Emphasis:

- **Train Station Project (`train station project.cpp`)**: This file is the most significant in terms of graph usage, where it demonstrates practical applications of graph theory in simulating real-world systems such as train stations. It emphasizes node connectivity, edge weighting, and efficient route planning.
